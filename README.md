Take 5 is a fairly simple game played by 2-10 players. The players are each dealt **10** cards, and then **4** cards are placed on the table in a row. Each of these 4 cards is the start of a column.

Each player selects **1** of their ten cards from their hand and plays it **simultaneously**. Then, in order from smallest to largest card number, the cards are placed in the four columns, adhering to the following rules:

1. The card must be higher than the previously highest card in that column
2. The column picked must be the one with the highest possible card value

When following these two rules, there is only one possible column for each card to be played in, and so all of the strategy for playing cards occurs before the players have played the cards. The subsequent locations of those cards on the board is deterministic.

When a player is forced to place their card as the **6th** card in a column, that player **must** take the first five cards into their scoring area, leaving behind their own card as the sole card in the column.

If a player plays a card that is **lower** than every possible column, that player must choose any column, take those cards into their scoring area, and leave behind their own card as the start to that column in its place.
